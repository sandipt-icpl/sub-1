# Unit Tests

The unit tests for the Prowler checks varies between each provider supported.

Here we left some good reads about unit testing and things we've learnt through all the process.

## General Recommendations

When creating tests for some provider's checks we follow these guidelines trying to cover as much test scenarios as possible:

1. Create a test without resource to generate 0 findings, because Prowler will generate 0 findings if a service does not contain the resources the check is looking for audit.
2. Create test to generate both a `PASS` and a `FAIL` result.
3. Create tests with more than 1 resource to evaluate how the check behaves and if the number of findings is right.

## How to run Prowler tests

To run the Prowler test suite you need to install the testing dependencies already included in the `pyproject.toml` file. If you didn't install it yet please read the developer guide introduction [here](./introduction.md#get-the-code-and-install-all-dependencies).

Then in the project's root path execute `pytest -n auto -vvv -s -x` or use the `Makefile` with `make test`.

Other commands to run tests:

- Run tests for a provider: `pytest -n auto -vvv -s -x tests/providers/<provider>/services`
- Run tests for a provider service: `pytest -n auto -vvv -s -x tests/providers/<provider>/services/<service>`
- Run tests for a provider check: `pytest -n auto -vvv -s -x tests/providers/<provider>/services/<service>/<check>`

> Refer to the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/getting-started.html) documentation for more information.

## AWS

For the AWS provider we have ways to test a Prowler check based on the following criteria:

> Note: We use and contribute to the [Moto](https://github.com/getmoto/moto) library which allows us to easily mock out tests based on AWS infrastructure. **It's awesome!**

- AWS API calls covered by [Moto](https://github.com/getmoto/moto):
    - Service tests with `@mock_<service>`
    - Checks tests with `@mock_<service>`
- AWS API calls not covered by Moto:
    - Service test with `mock_make_api_call`
    - Checks tests with [MagicMock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.MagicMock)
- AWS API calls partially covered by Moto:
    - Service test with `@mock_<service>` and `mock_make_api_call`
    - Checks tests with `@mock_<service>` and `mock_make_api_call`

In the following section we are going to explain all of the above scenarios with examples. The main difference between those scenarios comes from if the [Moto](https://github.com/getmoto/moto) library covers the AWS API calls made by the service. You can check the covered API calls [here](https://github.com/getmoto/moto/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATION_COVERAGE.md).

An important point for the AWS testing is that in each check we MUST have a unique `audit_info` which is the key object during the AWS execution to isolate the test execution.

Check the [Audit Info](./audit-info.md) section to get more details.

```python
# We need to import the AWS_Audit_Info and the Audit_Metadata
# to set the audit_info to call AWS APIs
from prowler.providers.aws.lib.audit_info.models import AWS_Audit_Info
from prowler.providers.common.models import Audit_Metadata

AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER = "123456789012"

def set_mocked_audit_info(self):
  audit_info = AWS_Audit_Info(
      session_config=None,
      original_session=None,
      audit_session=session.Session(
          profile_name=None,
          botocore_session=None,
      ),
      audit_config=None,
      audited_account=AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER,
      audited_account_arn=f"arn:aws:iam::{AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER}:root",
      audited_user_id=None,
      audited_partition="aws",
      audited_identity_arn=None,
      profile=None,
      profile_region=None,
      credentials=None,
      assumed_role_info=None,
      audited_regions=["us-east-1", "eu-west-1"],
      organizations_metadata=None,
      audit_resources=None,
      mfa_enabled=False,
      audit_metadata=Audit_Metadata(
          services_scanned=0,
          expected_checks=[],
          completed_checks=0,
          audit_progress=0,
      ),
  )

  return audit_info
```
### Checks

For the AWS tests examples we are going to use the tests for the `iam_password_policy_uppercase` check.

This section is going to be divided based on the API coverage of the [Moto](https://github.com/getmoto/moto) library.

#### API calls covered

If the [Moto](https://github.com/getmoto/moto) library covers the API calls we want to test, we can use the `@mock_<service>` decorator. This will mocked out all the API calls made to AWS keeping the state within the code decorated, in this case the test function.

```python
# We need to import the unittest.mock to allow us to patch some objects
# not to use shared ones between test, hence to isolate the test
from unittest import mock

# Boto3 client and session to call the AWS APIs
from boto3 import client, session

# Moto decorator for the IAM service we want to mock
from moto import mock_iam

# Constants used
AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER = "123456789012"
AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"


# We always name the test classes like Test_<check_name>
class Test_iam_password_policy_uppercase:

  # We include the Moto decorator for the service we want to use
  # You can include more than one if two or more services are
  # involved in test
  @mock_iam
  # We name the tests with test_<service>_<check_name>_<test_action>
  def test_iam_password_policy_no_uppercase_flag(self):
    # First, we have to create an IAM client
    iam_client = client("iam", region_name=AWS_REGION)

    # Then, since all the AWS accounts have a password
    # policy we want to set to False the RequireUppercaseCharacters
    iam_client.update_account_password_policy(RequireUppercaseCharacters=False)

    # We set a mocked audit_info for AWS not to share the same audit state
    # between checks
    current_audit_info = self.set_mocked_audit_info()

    # The Prowler service import MUST be made within the decorated
    # code not to make real API calls to the AWS service.
    from prowler.providers.aws.services.iam.iam_service import IAM

    # Prowler for AWS uses a shared object called `current_audit_info` where it stores
    # the audit's state, credentials and configuration.
    with mock.patch(
        "prowler.providers.aws.lib.audit_info.audit_info.current_audit_info",
        new=current_audit_info,
    ),
    # We have to mock also the iam_client from the check to enforce that the iam_client used is the one
    # created within this check because patch != import, and if you execute tests in parallel some objects
    # can be already initialised hence the check won't be isolated
      mock.patch(
        "prowler.providers.aws.services.iam.iam_password_policy_uppercase.iam_password_policy_uppercase.iam_client",
        new=IAM(current_audit_info),
    ):
        # We import the check within the two mocks not to initialise the iam_client with some shared information from
        # the current_audit_info or the IAM service.
        from prowler.providers.aws.services.iam.iam_password_policy_uppercase.iam_password_policy_uppercase import (
            iam_password_policy_uppercase,
        )

        # Once imported, we only need to instantiate the check's class
        check = iam_password_policy_uppercase()

        # And then, call the execute() function to run the check
        # against the IAM client we've set up.
        result = check.execute()

        # Last but not least, we need to assert all the fields
        # from the check's results
        assert len(results) == 1
        assert result[0].status == "FAIL"
        assert result[0].status_extended == "IAM password policy does not require at least one uppercase letter."
        assert result[0].resource_arn == f"arn:aws:iam::{AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER}:root"
        assert result[0].resource_id == AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER
        assert result[0].resource_tags == []
        assert result[0].region == AWS_REGION
```

#### API calls not covered

If the IAM service for the check's we want to test is not covered by Moto, we have to inject the objects in the service client using [MagicMock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.MagicMock). As we have pointed above, we cannot instantiate the service since it will make real calls to the AWS APIs.

> The following example uses the IAM GetAccountPasswordPolicy which is covered by Moto but this is only for demonstration purposes.

The following code shows how to use MagicMock to create the service objects.

```python
# We need to import the unittest.mock to allow us to patch some objects
# not to use shared ones between test, hence to isolate the test
from unittest import mock

# Constants used
AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER = "123456789012"
AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"


# We always name the test classes like Test_<check_name>
class Test_iam_password_policy_uppercase:

  # We name the tests with test_<service>_<check_name>_<test_action>
  def test_iam_password_policy_no_uppercase_flag(self):
    # Mocked client with MagicMock
    mocked_iam_client = mock.MagicMock

    # Since the IAM Password Policy has their own model we have to import it
    from prowler.providers.aws.services.iam.iam_service import PasswordPolicy

    # Create the mock PasswordPolicy object
    mocked_iam_client.password_policy = PasswordPolicy(
        length=5,
        symbols=True,
        numbers=True,
        # We set the value to False to test the check
        uppercase=False,
        lowercase=True,
        allow_change=False,
        expiration=True,
    )

    # We set a mocked audit_info for AWS not to share the same audit state
    # between checks
    current_audit_info = self.set_mocked_audit_info()

    # In this scenario we have to mock also the IAM service and the iam_client from the check to enforce    # that the iam_client used is the one created within this check because patch != import, and if you     # execute tests in parallel some objects can be already initialised hence the check won't be isolated.
    # In this case we don't use the Moto decorator, we use the mocked IAM client for both objects
    with mock.patch(
        "prowler.providers.aws.services.iam.iam_service.IAM",
        new=mocked_iam_client,
    ), mock.patch(
        "prowler.providers.aws.services.iam.iam_client.iam_client",
        new=mocked_iam_client,
    ):
        # We import the check within the two mocks not to initialise the iam_client with some shared information from
        # the current_audit_info or the IAM service.
        from prowler.providers.aws.services.iam.iam_password_policy_uppercase.iam_password_policy_uppercase import (
            iam_password_policy_uppercase,
        )

        # Once imported, we only need to instantiate the check's class
        check = iam_password_policy_uppercase()

        # And then, call the execute() function to run the check
        # against the IAM client we've set up.
        result = check.execute()

        # Last but not least, we need to assert all the fields
        # from the check's results
        assert len(results) == 1
        assert result[0].status == "FAIL"
        assert result[0].status_extended == "IAM password policy does not require at least one uppercase letter."
        assert result[0].resource_arn == f"arn:aws:iam::{AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER}:root"
        assert result[0].resource_id == AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER
        assert result[0].resource_tags == []
        assert result[0].region == AWS_REGION
```

As it can be seen in the above scenarios, the check execution should always be into the context of mocked/patched objects. This way we ensure it reviews only the objects created under the scope the test.

#### API calls partially covered

If the API calls we want to use in the service are partially covered by the Moto decorator we have to create our own mocked API calls to use it in combination.

To do so, you need to mock the `botocore.client.BaseClient._make_api_call` function, which is the Boto3 function in charge of making the real API call to the AWS APIs, using `mock.patch <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#patch>`:


```python

import boto3
import botocore
from unittest.mock import patch
from moto import mock_iam

# Original botocore _make_api_call function
orig = botocore.client.BaseClient._make_api_call

# Mocked botocore _make_api_call function
def mock_make_api_call(self, operation_name, kwarg):
    # As you can see the operation_name has the get_account_password_policy snake_case form but
    # we are using the GetAccountPasswordPolicy form.
    # Rationale -> https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/botocore/client.py#L810:L816
    if operation_name == 'GetAccountPasswordPolicy':
        return {
            'PasswordPolicy': {
                'MinimumPasswordLength': 123,
                'RequireSymbols': True|False,
                'RequireNumbers': True|False,
                'RequireUppercaseCharacters': True|False,
                'RequireLowercaseCharacters': True|False,
                'AllowUsersToChangePassword': True|False,
                'ExpirePasswords': True|False,
                'MaxPasswordAge': 123,
                'PasswordReusePrevention': 123,
                'HardExpiry': True|False
            }
        }
    # If we don't want to patch the API call
    return orig(self, operation_name, kwarg)

# We always name the test classes like Test_<check_name>
class Test_iam_password_policy_uppercase:

  # We include the custom API call mock decorator for the service we want to use
  @patch("botocore.client.BaseClient._make_api_call", new=mock_make_api_call)
  # We include also the IAM Moto decorator for the API calls supported
  @mock_iam
  # We name the tests with test_<service>_<check_name>_<test_action>
  def test_iam_password_policy_no_uppercase_flag(self):
    # Check the previous section to see the check test since is the same
```

Note that this does not use Moto, to keep it simple, but if you use any `moto`-decorators in addition to the patch, the call to `orig(self, operation_name, kwarg)` will be intercepted by Moto.

> The above code comes from here https://docs.getmoto.org/en/latest/docs/services/patching_other_services.html

#### Mocking more than one service

If the test your are creating belongs to a check that uses more than one provider service, you should mock each of the services used. For example, the check `cloudtrail_logs_s3_bucket_access_logging_enabled` requires the CloudTrail and the S3 client, hence the service's mock part of the test will be as follows:


```python
with mock.patch(
    "prowler.providers.aws.lib.audit_info.audit_info.current_audit_info",
    new=mock_audit_info,
), mock.patch(
    "prowler.providers.aws.services.cloudtrail.cloudtrail_logs_s3_bucket_access_logging_enabled.cloudtrail_logs_s3_bucket_access_logging_enabled.cloudtrail_client",
    new=Cloudtrail(mock_audit_info),
), mock.patch(
    "prowler.providers.aws.services.cloudtrail.cloudtrail_logs_s3_bucket_access_logging_enabled.cloudtrail_logs_s3_bucket_access_logging_enabled.s3_client",
    new=S3(mock_audit_info),
):
```


As you can see in the above code, it is required to mock the AWS audit info and both services used.


#### Patching vs. Importing

This is an important topic within the Prowler check's unit testing. Due to the dynamic nature of the check's load, the process of importing the service client from a check is the following:

1. `<check>.py`:
```python
from prowler.providers.<provider>.services.<service>.<service>_client import <service>_client
```
2. `<service>_client.py`:
```python
from prowler.providers.<provider>.lib.audit_info.audit_info import audit_info
from prowler.providers.<provider>.services.<service>.<service>_service import <SERVICE>

<service>_client = <SERVICE>(audit_info)
```

Due to the above import path it's not the same to patch the following objects because if you run a bunch of tests, either in parallel or not, some clients can be already instantiated by another check, hence your test execution will be using another test's service instance:

- `<service>_client` imported at `<check>.py`
- `<service>_client` initialised at `<service>_client.py`
- `<SERVICE>` imported at `<service>_client.py`

A useful read about this topic can be found in the following article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8658043/how-to-mock-an-import


#### Different ways to mock the service client

##### Mocking the service client at the service client level

Mocking a service client using the following code ...

```python title="Mocking the service_client"
with mock.patch(
    "prowler.providers.<provider>.lib.audit_info.audit_info.audit_info",
    new=audit_info,
), mock.patch(
    "prowler.providers.aws.services.<service>.<check>.<check>.<service>_client",
    new=<SERVICE>(audit_info),
):
```
will cause that the service will be initialised twice:

1. When the `<SERVICE>(audit_info)` is mocked out using `mock.patch` to have the object ready for the patching.
2. At the `<service>_client.py` when we are patching it since the `mock.patch` needs to go to that object an initialise it, hence the `<SERVICE>(audit_info)` will be called again.

Then, when we import the `<service>_client.py` at `<check>.py`, since we are mocking where the object is used, Python will use the mocked one.

In the [next section](./unit-testing.md#mocking-the-service-and-the-service-client-at-the-service-client-level) you will see an improved version to mock objects.


##### Mocking the service and the service client at the service client level
Mocking a service client using the following code ...

```python title="Mocking the service and the service_client"
with mock.patch(
    "prowler.providers.<provider>.lib.audit_info.audit_info.audit_info",
    new=audit_info,
), mock.patch(
    "prowler.providers.aws.services.<service>.<SERVICE>",
    new=<SERVICE>(audit_info),
) as service_client, mock.patch(
    "prowler.providers.aws.services.<service>.<service>_client.<service>_client",
    new=service_client,
):
```
will cause that the service will be initialised once, just when the `<SERVICE>(audit_info)` is mocked out using `mock.patch`.

Then, at the check_level when Python tries to import the client with `from prowler.providers.<provider>.services.<service>.<service>_client`, since it is already mocked out, the execution will continue using the `service_client` without getting into the `<service>_client.py`.


### Services

For testing the AWS services we have to follow the same logic as with the AWS checks, we have to check if the AWS API calls made by the service are covered by Moto and we have to test the service `__init__` to verifiy that the information is being correctly retrieved.

The service tests could act as *Integration Tests* since we test how the service retrieves the information from the provider, but since Moto or the custom mock objects mocks that calls this test will fall into *Unit Tests*.

Please refer to the [AWS checks tests](./unit-testing.md#checks) for more information on how to create tests and check the existing services tests [here](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler/tree/master/tests/providers/aws/services).

## GCP

### Checks

For the GCP Provider we don't have any library to mock out the API calls we use. So in this scenario we inject the objects in the service client using [MagicMock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.MagicMock).

The following code shows how to use MagicMock to create the service objects for a GCP check test.

```python
# We need to import the unittest.mock to allow us to patch some objects
# not to use shared ones between test, hence to isolate the test
from unittest import mock

# GCP Constants

    def test_compute_compute_firewall_rdp_access_from_the_internet_allowed_one_compliant_rule_with_valid_port(self):
        # Mocked client with MagicMock
        compute_client = mock.MagicMock

        # Assign GCP client configuration
        compute_client.project_ids = [GCP_PROJECT_ID]
        compute_client.region = "global"

        # Import the service resource model to create the mocked object
        from prowler.providers.gcp.services.compute.compute_service import Firewall

        # Create the custom Firewall object to be tested
        firewall = Firewall(
            name="test",
            id="1234567890",
            source_ranges=["0.0.0.0/0"],
            direction="INGRESS",
            allowed_rules=[{"IPProtocol": "tcp", "ports": ["443"]}],
            project_id=GCP_PROJECT_ID,
        )
        compute_client.firewalls = [firewall]

        # In this scenario we have to mock also the Compute service and the compute_client from the check to enforce that the compute_client used is the one created within this check because patch != import, and if you execute tests in parallel some objects can be already initialised hence the check won't be isolated.
        # In this case we don't use the Moto decorator, we use the mocked Compute client for both objects
        with mock.patch(

            )

            # Once imported, we only need to instantiate the check's class
            check = compute_firewall_rdp_access_from_the_internet_allowed()

            # And then, call the execute() function to run the check
            # against the IAM client we've set up.
            result = check.execute()

            # Last but not least, we need to assert all the fields
            # from the check's results
            assert len(result) == 1
            assert result[0].status == "PASS"
            assert result[0].status_extended == f"Firewall {firewall.name} does not expose port 3389 (RDP) to the internet."
            assert result[0].resource_name = firewall.name
            assert result[0].resource_id == firewall.id
            assert result[0].project_id = GCP_PROJECT_ID
            assert result[0].location = compute_client.region
```

### Services

## Azure

### Checks

For the Azure Provider we don't have any library to mock out the API calls we use. So in this scenario we inject the objects in the service client using [MagicMock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.MagicMock).

The following code shows how to use MagicMock to create the service objects for a Azure check test.

```python
# We need to import the unittest.mock to allow us to patch some objects
# not to use shared ones between test, hence to isolate the test
from unittest import mock

from uuid import uuid4

# Azure Constants
AZURE_SUSCRIPTION = str(uuid4())



# We are going to create a test for the Test_defender_ensure_defender_for_arm_is_on check
class Test_defender_ensure_defender_for_arm_is_on:

    def test_defender_defender_ensure_defender_for_arm_is_on_arm_pricing_tier_not_standard(self):
        resource_id = str(uuid4())

        # Mocked client with MagicMock
        defender_client = mock.MagicMock

        # Import the service resource model to create the mocked object
        from prowler.providers.azure.services.defender.defender_service import Defender_Pricing
